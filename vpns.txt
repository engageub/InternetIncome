# Add all environment variables for each gluetun container. An example below
# -e VPN_TYPE=openvpn -e OPENVPN_USER='someusername' -e OPENVPN_PASSWORD='somepassword'
# Place the value between single quotes for password as mentioned above for OPENVPN_PASSWORD.
# Make sure your password does not already contain single or double quotes; otherwise, you will need to use a backslash to escape these characters.
# If a country or value has space in between, please use single quotes to close it. An example below 
# -e SERVER_COUNTRIES='Isle of Man'
# Refer to the following documentation on adding environmental variables. Do not add anything apart from volumes and environment variables in each line.
# https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun-wiki/tree/main/setup/providers
# Each line should have configuration for a separate vpn
# Note: HideMyAss dropped support for Linux OpenVPN so this will likely not work anymore. https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun/issues/1498
