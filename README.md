This script lets you earn income by sharing your internet bandwidth. The income is passive and you don't have to do anything after the setup but keep getting payouts to your account.
The main advantage of this script is the use of multiple proxies through docker containers. 
This script has been tested in linux amd64, arm64 or aarch64 platforms. 
Your income depends on the number of proxies used and the location of proxy. If you use all the apps mentioned, you can earn about $50 per month or more from 1 IP depending on the location of the proxy.

* Not Supported are the apps which are not available in docker environment, you may use them in windows.
* [Adnade](https://t.co/KthcbzPa08) and [Ebesucher](https://www.ebesucher.com/?ref=engageub) use firefox browser inside the container, so they consume more resources compared to other containers.

* No Limit indicates the website has not mentioned any specifics about it and multiproxies were working. Try to use 1 device per IP if possible.

## :house_with_garden:	Prerequisites 	
Run the following commands to install or update docker.

Ubuntu 20.04 is recommended. 

![Linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-FCC624?style=for-the-badge&logo=linux&logoColor=black)
### Install docker on Linux
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install docker.io
```
If you are using arm or aarch linux OS, you also need to install [binfmt](https://hub.docker.com/r/tonistiigi/binfmt) emulator to support amd64 images on your pc.
### For ARM or AARCH Architectures
```
sudo docker run --privileged --rm tonistiigi/binfmt --install all
sudo apt-get install qemu binfmt-support qemu-user-static
```

![Windows](https://img.shields.io/badge/Windows-0078D6?style=for-the-badge&logo=windows&logoColor=white)
### Install Docker on Windows
Follow this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ezNqqaSjq8) till 7.30 minutes where docker runs on ubuntu and then follow the next steps below to download the code.
  
![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/docker-%230db7ed.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=docker&logoColor=white)  
### Want to try docker for free without installation?
If you like to use docker directly for free, you can use [Play with Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/). It resets every 4 hours. 
## :point_down:	What next:question:	
Download the code and edit the configuration file properties.conf with your account details.  
If you don't have GUI access but have terminal access, use the following commands to download the code.
### Download the code
```
wget https://github.com/engageub/InternetIncome/archive/refs/heads/tunproxy.zip
sudo apt-get install unzip
unzip tunproxy.zip
cd InternetIncome-tunproxy
```
* Please edit the "properties.conf" file using the following instructions and save the changes.  
* If you are using proxies, please set the "USE_PROXIES" value to "true". 
* When setting your email, password, or token, always place them between single quotes ('') to consider special characters.
* If you do not wish to use a particular application, leave the default value as it is, and the script will not run for that application.
### Update configuration and save
```
vi properties.conf
```
## :runner: Run the script
After you have followed all the mentioned above steps just run the following command to start and check your income flow to you:money_mouth_face:	.
### Start the process
```
sudo bash internetIncome.sh --start
```
## :stop_sign: Stop and Delete containers
To stop and delete all the containers started with the script. Run the following command.  Note that for earnapp, proxyrack, traffmonetizer and mysterium the data is not deleted and same ids will be used on delete and start, since it is required to do manual setup each time you start. Delete them or use a different folder to download the script if you want to change the node ids.
### Stop and delete containers
Note that back up of device Ids and node Ids are present in the same folder of the script. 
```
sudo bash internetIncome.sh --delete
```
### Delete backup files and folders
To delete the backup files and folders created by the script, use the following command. This will also delete mysterium data, so if you already made payment for the node take a backup before runnning the command.
```
sudo bash internetIncome.sh --deleteBackup
```
