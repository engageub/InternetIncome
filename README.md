This script lets you earn income by sharing your internet bandwidth. The income is passive and you don't have to do anything after the setup but keep getting payouts to your account.
The main advantage of this script is the use of multiple proxies through docker containers. 
This script has been tested on Linux amd64, armv7, arm64, and aarch64 platforms. 
Your income depends on the number of proxies used and the proxy location. If you use all the apps mentioned, you can earn about $50 per month or more from 1 IP depending on the location of the proxy and demand.
Please read the respective apps' legal terms or FAQ section if you have any queries on the type of traffic sent. 
For advanced users, please use the [test](https://github.com/engageub/InternetIncome/tree/test) branch.

### Want to try Docker for free without installation?
If you like to use Docker directly for free, you can use [Play with Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/). It resets every 2 hours. Please use the [tunproxy](https://github.com/engageub/InternetIncome/tree/tunproxy) branch to test it using proxies.
## üëá	Next steps‚ùì	
Download the code and edit the configuration file properties.conf with your account details.  
If you don't have GUI access but have terminal access, you can use the following commands to download the code.
### Download the code
```
wget -O main.zip https://github.com/engageub/InternetIncome/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
sudo apt-get install unzip
unzip -o main.zip
cd InternetIncome-main
```
* Please edit the "properties.conf" file using the following instructions and save the changes.  
* If you are using proxies, please set the `USE_PROXIES` value to `true`. 
* When setting your email, password, or token, always place them between single quotes ('') to consider special characters. 
* If you do not wish to use a particular application, leave the default value as it is, and the script will not run for that application.
### Update configuration and save
```
vi properties.conf
```
## :runner: Run the script
After you have followed all the mentioned above steps just run the following command to start and check your income flow to you :money_mouth_face:	.
### Start the process
```
sudo bash internetIncome.sh --start
```
## :stop_sign: Stop and Delete containers
To stop and delete all the containers started with the script. Run the following command.  Note that for Earnapp, Proxyrack, Traffmonetizer, and mysterium the data is not deleted and the same IDs will be used on delete and start since it is required to do a manual setup each time you start. Delete them or use a different folder to download the script if you want to change the node IDs.
### Stop and delete containers
Note that the backup of device IDs and node IDs are present in the same folder of the script. 
```
sudo bash internetIncome.sh --delete
```
### Delete backup files and folders
To delete the backup files and folders created by the script, use the following command.
```
sudo bash internetIncome.sh --deleteBackup
```

### Estimate Potential Earnings
To get a rough estimate of potential daily and monthly earnings based on your configured services:
```bash
sudo bash internetIncome.sh --estimate-earnings
```
**Note:** These are highly speculative estimates and actual earnings can vary significantly based on demand, location, and network conditions.

### Check Container Status
To check the status of containers managed by this script:
```bash
sudo bash internetIncome.sh --status
```
This will show whether each container is running, exited, or in another state.

### Ebesucher/Adnade Automatic Restart Changes

**Important Note:** The previous mechanism for automatically restarting Ebesucher and Adnade browser instances using Docker-in-Docker (DinD) has been removed from `internetIncome.sh`. This change was made due to compatibility issues and to simplify the script's dependencies.

If you relied on this automatic restart functionality, you will need to set up an alternative method. We recommend using a cron job on your host system to periodically execute the `restart.sh` script with the appropriate arguments.

**What is a cron job?**
A cron job is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like computer operating systems. Users can schedule jobs (commands or shell scripts) to run periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals.

**How to set up a cron job for restarting Ebesucher/Adnade:**

1.  **Open your crontab:**
    You can edit your user's crontab file by running the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    crontab -e
    ```
    If prompted, choose an editor (like nano).

2.  **Add a cron job entry:**
    You'll need to add a line to this file for each service you want to restart. The format is:
    `[minute] [hour] [day_of_month] [month] [day_of_week] [command_to_execute]`

    *   Replace `/path/to/InternetIncome-main` with the actual absolute path to your `InternetIncome-main` directory.

    **Example Cron Job Entries:**

    *   **To restart Adnade every 6 hours:**
        ```cron
        0 */6 * * * cd /path/to/InternetIncome-main && sudo bash restart.sh --restartAdnade >> /path/to/InternetIncome-main/adnade_restart.log 2>&1
        ```

    *   **To restart Ebesucher (Firefox) once a day at 3:00 AM:**
        ```cron
        0 3 * * * cd /path/to/InternetIncome-main && sudo bash restart.sh --restartFirefox >> /path/to/InternetIncome-main/ebesucher_firefox_restart.log 2>&1
        ```

    *   **To restart Ebesucher (Chrome) every 12 hours:**
        ```cron
        0 */12 * * * cd /path/to/InternetIncome-main && sudo bash restart.sh --restartChrome >> /path/to/InternetIncome-main/ebesucher_chrome_restart.log 2>&1
        ```

    **Explanation of the cron job:**
    *   `0 */6 * * *`: This means "at minute 0 of every 6th hour."
    *   `0 3 * * *`: This means "at 03:00 (3 AM) every day."
    *   `cd /path/to/InternetIncome-main`: This changes the directory to where your `internetIncome.sh` and `restart.sh` scripts are located. **It is crucial to use the correct absolute path.**
    *   `sudo bash restart.sh --restartAdnade`: This is the command that executes the restart.
    *   `>> /path/to/InternetIncome-main/adnade_restart.log 2>&1`: This is optional but recommended. It redirects the output (both standard output and errors) of the command to a log file, so you can check if the restarts are happening correctly. Make sure the log path is writable.

3.  **Save and exit:**
    If you used nano, press `Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`.

This manual setup gives you more control over the restart schedule and avoids the complexities of DinD. Remember to adjust the cron schedule and paths to fit your specific needs.
